**Today's Progress**: Simple website sketches and initial project set up.

**Thoughts:** Starting from scratch on a old project that I completed at the beginning of a course I took. I cringe at the how it looks and operates, it relies on old Javascript and HTML. Here are some of the sketches for the site. I decided to work with the MERN stack and use Tailwind as the css framework. It took a bit to figure out the scripts. 

Used this link as a reference to set up the front end: [https://daveceddia.com/tailwind-create-react-app/](https://daveceddia.com/tailwind-create-react-app/)
